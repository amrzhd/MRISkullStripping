# MRI Skull Stripping Using UNet3D

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a deep learning model for MRI skull stripping using the Calgary Campinas 359 dataset. The primary goal is to accurately segment brain tissue from MRI scans, which is a crucial preprocessing step for many neuroimaging studies.

## Dataset

- **Name:** Calgary Campinas 359 Dataset
- **Description:** This dataset contains MRI scans used for brain tissue segmentation. It includes a variety of MRI sequences and has been curated specifically for the purpose of skull stripping.

## Model Architecture

### UNet3D

The model used in this project is a 3D version of the UNet architecture, designed to handle volumetric data such as MRI scans. UNet3D is known for its encoder-decoder structure, which is particularly effective for segmentation tasks in 3D medical imaging.

## Required Packages

To run this project, ensure that the following Python packages are installed:

- TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on the framework used)
- NumPy
- SciPy
- scikit-learn
- nibabel
- matplotlib
- [Include other necessary packages here]

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**  
2. **Setup the Environment**  
3. **Prepare the Dataset**  
4. **Run the Model**

## Results

The model's performance will be evaluated using standard metrics like Dice coefficient, precision, and recall, which are provided at the end of the notebook.
