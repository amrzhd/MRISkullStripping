# MRI Skull Stripping Using UNet3D

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a deep learning model for MRI skull stripping using the Calgary Campinas 359 dataset. The primary goal is to accurately segment brain tissue from MRI scans, which is a crucial preprocessing step for many neuroimaging studies.

## Dataset
T1-weighted volumetric brain MR images used in this project is sourced from the [Calgary Campinas 359 Dataset](https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/calgary-campinas)
- 359 Participants
- Acquisition matrix size 256 x 218 x [170,180]
- 1.5 T and 3 T Magnetic Field Strength
- Voxel size for images is 1 mmÂ³
  
## Model
The model used in this project is a 3D version of the UNet architecture, designed to handle volumetric data such as MRI scans. UNet3D is known for its encoder-decoder structure, which is particularly effective for segmentation tasks in 3D medical imaging.
